# eBPF project

eBPF is a revolutionary technology with origins in the Linux kernel that can run sandboxed programs in a privileged context such as the operating system kernel. It is used to safely and efficiently extend the capabilities of the kernel without requiring to change kernel source code or load kernel modules.

Historically, the operating system has always been an ideal place to implement observability, security, and networking functionality due to the kernelâ€™s privileged ability to oversee and control the entire system. At the same time, an operating system kernel is hard to evolve due to its central role and high requirement towards stability and security. The rate of innovation at the operating system level has thus traditionally been lower compared to functionality implemented outside of the operating system. [[1]](https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf/)

In this semester project **bcc** (BPF Compiler Collection) toolkit and **bpftrace** are being used.
BCC tracing tools can be seen on next image:

## BCC & bpftrace

### BCC

BCC makes BPF programs easier to write, with kernel instrumentation in C (and includes a C wrapper around LLVM), and front-ends in Python and lua. It is suited for many tasks, including performance analysis and network traffic control.  

Usual BCC program consists of C code inserted inside Python code. Examples can be seen in [bcc](bcc/) directory.

### Bpftrace

The bpftrace (bt) language is inspired by the D language used by dtrace and uses the same program structure. Each script consists of a preamble and one or more action blocks. Preprocessor and type definitions take place in the preamble.[[2]](https://github.com/bpftrace/bpftrace/blob/master/man/adoc/bpftrace.adoc)  
Action block structure:

```D
probe[,probe]
/predicate/ {
  action
}
```

The predicate is an optional condition that must be met for the action to be executed.

## Probes

- **Kernel probes**  
  Dynamic access to internal components in the kernel.
  - kprobes
  - kretprobes
- **Tracepoints**  
  Static access to internal components in the kernel.
  - tracepoint
  - rawtracepoint
- **User-space probes**  
  Dynamic access to programs running in user-space.
  - uprobes
  - uretprobes
- **User statically defined tracepoints(USDT)**  
  Static access to programs running in user-space.

### List probes & tracepoints

```bash
sudo perf list
cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/available_events
sudo bpftrace -l
sudo bpftrace -l "rawtracepoint:*" | wc -l
sudo bpftrace -l 'kprobe:*'
```

## Python and bpftrace scripts

### Python script examples

 1. **users_command.py**: Print what command is run by which user (uretprobe)
 2. **filetop.py**: Top for files, R/W by processes (kprobe)
 3. **xdp_drop_count.py**: Count dropped packets by XDP
 4. **tracepoint.py**: Various network tracepoints

<a href="/images/python_scripts_ex.png"><img src="/images/python_scripts_ex.png" border="0" width="700" alt="Python scripts example"/></a>

### Bpftrace script examples

 1. **opensnoop.bt**: Trace open() syscalls (tracepoint)
 2. **key_pressed.bt**: Prints which key is pressed and top 10 pressed after exiting
 3. **others.bt**: Prints details of mkdir calls, IP and MAC addresses when ARP is sent

## Examples of working with kernel

### others.bt - arp_create

Inside kernel definition of **arp_create**, located in arp.h:

<a href="/images/arp_create.png"><img src="/images/arp_create.png" border="0" width="500" alt="Arp create kernel"/></a>

Implementation inside others.bt for **arp_create** kprobe:

```D
kprobe:arp_create {
  $sip = arg4;
  $dip = arg2;
  $smac = sarg0; // arg6
  $dmac = sarg1; // arg5
  time("%H:%M:%S ");
  printf("SRC: %16s %s", ntop($sip), macaddr($smac));
  printf(" -> DST: %16s %s\n", ntop($dip), macaddr($dmac));
}
```

### key_pressed.bt - input_event

Kprobe input_event kernel code([link](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/input/input.c)):

```c
void input_event(struct input_dev *dev,
		 unsigned int type, unsigned int code, int value)
{
	unsigned long flags;

	if (is_event_supported(type, dev->evbit, EV_MAX)) {

		spin_lock_irqsave(&dev->event_lock, flags);
		input_handle_event(dev, type, code, value);
		spin_unlock_irqrestore(&dev->event_lock, flags);
	}
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(input_event);
```

Implementation inside key_pressed.bt, saving args inside local variable:

```D
kprobe:input_event {
    $dev = arg0;
    $type = arg1;
    $code = arg2;
    $value = arg3;
    ...
}
```

## XDP - eXpress Data Path

Express Data Path (XDP) is a high-performance packet processing framework within the Linux kernel, designed to allow network packets to be processed as they arrive at the network interface card (NIC), enabling extremely low-latency and high-throughput networking applications.
Enables custom packet processing to be executed directly within the network driver, before the packets are passed to the kernel's networking stack.  
One of the reasons why big companies like Amazon can survive huge DDOS attacks with less impact on services.
